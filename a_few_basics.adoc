Each title page and colophon section must begin with a single `=`. which means that indicating a Head1 requires `==`.




[[headers]]
=== Headers

In asciidoc you cannot jump directly from a Head 1 to a Head 3 or 4. Your headers must appear in sequence from Head 1 to Head 2, and onward. If you skip over a header in the sequence, asciidoctor throws an error.

```adoc
= Title head (book or report title)

== Head 1 (chapter title)

=== Head 2 (section title)

=== Head 3 (subsection)

==== Head 4 (sub-subsection)
```
