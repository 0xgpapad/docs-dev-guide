== AsciiDoc authoring for RISC-V contributors

As a contributor to RISC-V, your contributions will likely be in one of the two following categories:

* Adding content to an existing specification.
* Creating an entirely new specification.

In either case, please feel free to examine the AsciiDoc source files for this `example.pdf` and adapt the markup for your use.

=== About Asciidoctor

AsciiDoc is the markup language and Asciidoctor is a set of toolchains that support publishing from AsciiDoc.

There are three major Asciidoctor toolchains:

* Ruby, which is well-established and which we are using.
* Antora, which is relatively new and which uses NPM.
* Python-based, which is legacy and in maintenance mode.

=== RISC-V AsciiDoc authoring assets

Please view the https://github.com/riscv/docs-templates[readme] in the docs-templates repo for information about the automated build processes.

The docs-templates repo also contains assets, such as fonts, styles, directory structure, and themes that you need for RISC-V specifications, along with a https://github.com/riscv/docs-templates/commit/5c18cc9761eb3f6516975ee0c109729a4ce66b93[document] that takes you through a local install process that supports all of the required features for a local build.

Although testing your markup by building a PDF is good practice, you can catch many common errors by simply downloading Asciidoctor and building the HTMl5 output using the following command:

[source,cmd]
----
asciidoctor book_header.adoc
----

=== Simply writing

To begin authoring in AsciiDoc, select a text editor. <<editors>> lists the editors that support authoring in AsciiDoc.

For quick reference, see https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference]. Most of the markup for the specifications is simple and have a familiar feel to people who have used Git-flavored Markdown. For RISC-V specifications, it is the procedures for <<graphics>> that add complexity.

The https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc Writers Guide] contains details about AsciiDoc markup. For PDF generation, you can find details at https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf#install-the-published-gem[asciidoctor-pdf].

==== Text editors that support AsciiDoc authoring

There isn't a true WYSIWYG editor for AsciiDoc. However, there are live preview options that are listed in the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/tooling/[Asciidoctor documentation] that can help you see what the output looks like. You can also use your favorite text editor, or perhaps switch to one that has good AsciiDoc linting.

The following list contains links to resources for text editor/IDE support of AsciiDoc:

While ghostwriter does support Markdown, it does not support AsciiDoc at this time.

==== Build often

As soon as you install Asciidoctor on your computer, you can check that each individual file builds in HTML by running `asciidoctor filename.adoc` on any file. You can also check that the book or report on which you are working builds into HTML by running `asciidoctor bookname.adoc` or `asciidoctor reportname.adoc` on the book or report header. The strings `filename`, `bookname`, and `reportname` all can be replaced with the actual names that you are using.

Asciidoctor has fairly good error messages and usually lets you know the file and row number where the build first breaks.
