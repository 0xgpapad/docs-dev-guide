== Blocks, notes and markers

RISC-V specifications are notable for their extended commentaries that explain the thinking behind various important aspects of the technologies.

In most cases, contributors should make use of admonition blocks for their commentaries.


=== Blocks

Asciidoctor allows for many types of blocks, as documented at https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/blocks/.

Sidebars might be a good solution for some content in the specifications.

[source,adoc]
----
Text in your document.

****
This is content in a sidebar block.

=== Admonition blocks

Five kinds of standard admonition blocks are available in asciidoc and these can be mapped to either default or custom icons.

[source,adoc]
----
[NOTE]
====
This is an example of an admonition block.

Unlike an admonition paragraph, it may contain any AsciiDoc content.
The style can be any one of the admonition labels:

* NOTE
* TIP
* WARNING
* CAUTION
* IMPORTANT
====
----

This renders as:

The style can be any one of the admonition labels:

* TIP
* WARNING
* CAUTION
* IMPORTANT
====

For a single paragraph admonition, simply use a double colon:

[source,adoc]
----
NOTE:: Note content.
----

which renders as:

NOTE:: Note content.

.Feeding the Werewolves
====
While werewolves are hardy community members, keep in mind the following dietary concerns:

. They are allergic to cinnamon.
. More than two glasses of orange juice in 24 hours makes them howl in harmony with alarms and sirens.
. Celery makes them sad.

=== Footnotes

Asciidoc has a limitation in that footnotes appear at the end of each chapter. Asciidoctor does not support footnotes appearing at the bottom of each page.

You can add footnotes to your presentation using the footnote macro (`footnote\:[]`). If you plan to reference a footnote more than once, use the footnote macro with a target (`footnote\:id[]`).

[source,adoc]
----
The hail-and-rainbow protocol can be initiated at three levels:

. doublefootnote:[The double hail-and-rainbow level makes my toes tingle.]
. tertiary
. apocalyptic

A bold statement!footnote:disclaimer[Opinions are my own.]

Another outrageous statement.footnote:disclaimer[]
----

Renders as:

. doublefootnote:[The double hail-and-rainbow level makes my toes tingle.]
. tertiary
. apocalyptic

A bold statement!footnote:disclaimer[Opinions are my own.]

Another outrageous statement.footnote:disclaimer[]

=== Index markers

There are two types of index terms in AsciiDoc:

*A flow index term.* appears in the flow of text (i.e., a visible term) and in the index. This type of index term can only be used to define a primary entry:

[source,adoc]
----
indexterm2:[<primary>] or ((<primary>))
----

*A concealed index term.* a group of index terms that appear only in the index. This type of index term can be used to define a primary entry as well as optional secondary and tertiary entries:

[source,adoc]
----
indexterm:[<primary>, <secondary>, <tertiary>
----

--or--

[source,adoc]
----
(((<primary>, <secondary>, <tertiary>)))
----


[source,adoc]
----
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite,
held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water,
signifying by divine providence that I, ((Arthur)), (1)
was to carry Excalibur (((Sword, Broadsword, Excalibur))). (2)
That is why I am your king. Shut up! Will you shut up?!
Burn her anyway! I'm not a witch.
Look, my liege! We found them.

indexterm2:[Lancelot] was one of the Knights of the Round Table. (3)
indexterm:[knight, Knight of the Round Table, Lancelot] (4)
----

. The double parenthesis form adds a primary index term and includes the term in the generated output.
. The triple parenthesis form allows for an optional second and third index term and does not include the terms in the generated output (i.e., concealed index term).
. The inline macro indexterm2:[primary] is equivalent to the double parenthesis form.
. The inline macro indexterm:[primary, secondary, tertiary] is equivalent to the triple parenthesis form.

If youâ€™re defining a concealed index term (i.e., the indexterm macro), and one of the terms contains a comma, you must surround that segment in double quotes so the comma is treated as content. For example:

[source,adoc]
----
I, King Arthur.
indexterm:[knight, "Arthur, King"]
----

--or--

[source,adoc]
----
I, King Arthur.
(((knight, "Arthur, King")))
