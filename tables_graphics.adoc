== Tables and graphics


Asciidoc makes standard tables easy and also supports the creation of complex tables.

AsciiDoc tables can also be created directly from CSV data. Just set the format block attribute to csv and insert CSV data inside the block delimiters directly:

```csv
[%header,format=csv]
|===
Artist,Track,Genre
Baauer,Harlem Shake,Hip Hop
The Lumineers,Ho Hey,Folk Rock
|===
```

The above renders as follows:

[%header,format=csv]
|===
Artist,Track,Genre
Baauer,Harlem Shake,Hip Hop
The Lumineers,Ho Hey,Folk Rock
|===


Here is an additional example of what can be done with tables:

```csv
[cols="e,m,^,>s",width="25%"]
|============================
|1 >s|2 |3 |4
^|5 2.2+^.^|6 .3+<.>m|7
^|8
|9 2+>|10
|============================
```

Which renders as follows:

[cols="e,m,^,>s",width="25%"]
|============================
|1 >s|2 |3 |4
^|5 2.2+^.^|6 .3+<.>m|7
^|8
|9 2+>|10
|============================

An encoding table:

[#proposed-16bit-encodings-1]
.proposed 16-bit encodings-1
[width="100%",options=header]
|===
|15 |14 |13 |12 |11 |10 |9 |8 |7 |6 |5 |4 |3 |2 |1 |0 |instruction
3+|100|1|0|0|0 2+|field|0 |0 2+|00 | field 2+|00|mnemonic1
3+|100|1|0|0 3+|field|bit|1 3+|field 2+|00|mnemonic2
3+|110|1|0|0 3+|field|1 |0 3+|field 2+|00|mnemonic3
17+|This row spans the whole table
3+|100|1|1|1 8+|    field        2+| 00  | mnemonic4

The graphical elements--those for the various diagrams--add the most complexity. Even as we are using wavedrom to simplify the creation of accurate svgs for register diagrams, itâ€™s impossible to eliminate some inherent complexity.
